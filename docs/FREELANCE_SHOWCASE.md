## Example Freelance Platforms to Target

### Good Fit:
- **Upwork:** AI/ML category, plenty of clients
- **Toptal:** Higher-end clients, but harder to get in
- **Gun.io:** Tech-focused freelance platform
- **LinkedIn:** Direct outreach to businesses

### Poor Fit:
- **Fiverr:** Too low-budget for complex AI work
- **Freelancer.com:** Race to the bottom on pricing

## Bottom Line for Freelance

Your current project shows **technical skill** but not **business value**.

**Current Score: 4/10** for freelance showcase
- Technical but not client-focused
- No live demo
- No clear pricing
- Too academic

**With Changes: 9/10**
- Live demo anyone can try
- Clear ROI and business benefits
- Pricing packages ready
- Case studies showing real impact
- Video showing you can explain complex things simply

**Time Investment:** 2-3 days of focused work
**Potential Impact:** 5-10x more client interest

The difference between getting clients and not is often just **packaging and positioning**, not technical capability.
